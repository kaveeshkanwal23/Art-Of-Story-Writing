# Art-Of-Story-Writing
As the name suggests, a user story or user's story is the art of telling/writing a story as a user of the product. It basically defines the needs and aspirations of a user. 
A well written user story helps to: 
- brings everyone on the same page regarding definition of done
- detail out each aspect and interaction so that no doubt is left in the minds of the engineers
- estimate the effort via story points during product backlog refine SCRUM session
- assign it to the correct engineer & QA (if required)
- track the progress of the work by assigning it to a sprint.
