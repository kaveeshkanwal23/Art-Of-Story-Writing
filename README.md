# Art-Of-Story-Writing
As the name suggests, a user story or user's story is the art of telling/writing a story as a user of the product. It basically defines the needs and aspirations of a user. 
A well written user story helps to: 
- brings everyone on the same page regarding definition of done
- detail out each aspect and interaction so that no doubt is left in the minds of the engineers
- estimate the effort via story points during product backlog refine SCRUM session
- assign it to the correct engineer & QA (if required)
- track the progress of the work by assigning it to a sprint.


# User Story Standard Format:
As a (user-type), I want to (action to be performed), so that (result or outcome).

User type or persona type is the type of user who will interact with your product. User type can be say an admin, sales head for say a b2b product. It can be anything from a delivery agent, user ordering food online etc for b2c. Long story short, user type is very specific to your product use case.  

# Description
Write a crisp description of the story. It does not have to be long, but must elborate on the objective of the user story.

# Acceptance Criteria
- This is the most critical part of the user story. It detail out the defination of done of the user story. It must be written point wise. It may follow a predefined prefix such as the following:
"must ensure that (whatever task needs to be completed)"

- ACs must help the engineers to be absolutely clear on what is required to be executed. ACs must give absolute clarity to the engineers regarding what needs to be done. Engineers love details and ACs must provide the required detailing to them. 

- During the product backlog grooming session, I would ask the egineers to take 2-3 mins and do a silient reading of the user story and each of the accpetance criteria and then do the effort estimation based on story points using fibonacci numbers - 1,1,2,3,5, and 8. 8 being the most complex and most probably the story needs to be broken down further to maybe 2-3 more stories.

- As a thumb rule I would make sure that any story should not take more than 1-3 days to get completed.  

- Again, as a thumb rule, i would make sure that the written ACs must not go beyond half to one full laption screen length.

- So, 5 would be the max points a story would get, and even then I would do consultation with the engineers in case there is further scope to break the story for more clarity and better effort estimation.

# Assignee
- Once the effort estimation has been done, the story needs to be assigned to an engineer.

# QA allocation.
- Every story must also be allocated to a QA as well. The QA will use the story to write his own test cases and make sure that all the ACs have been covered by the engineers. QA signoff is required on each story before deploying it to production.
