# Art-Of-Story-Writing
As the name suggests, a user story or user's story is the art of telling/writing a story as a user of the product. It basically defines the needs and aspirations of a user. 
A well written user story helps to: 
- brings everyone on the same page regarding definition of done
- detail out each aspect and interaction so that no doubt is left in the minds of the engineers
- estimate the effort via story points during product backlog refine SCRUM session
- assign it to the correct engineer & QA (if required)
- track the progress of the work by assigning it to a sprint.


# User Story Standard Format:
As a (user-type), I want to (action to be performed), so that (result or outcome).

User type or persona type is the type of user who will interact with your product. User type can be say an admin, sales head for say a b2b product. It can be anything from a delivery agent, user ordering food online etc for b2c. Long story short, user type is very specific to your product use case.
